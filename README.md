# Fashion-MNIST-Classification-with-Feed-Forward-Neural-Network-Python

# Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation and training of a Feed-Forward Neural Network (Multi-Layer Perceptron) to classify fashion items from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset includes 60,000 training and 10,000 test greyscale images, each representing one of 10 clothing categories (e.g., T-shirts, sneakers, bags).

# The goal is to build a neural network model that accurately predicts the class of a fashion item based solely on the image input.

# Dataset
Name: Fashion MNIST

Size: 70,000 images (28x28 pixels)

Categories: 10 clothing types

Source: Fashion MNIST on Kaggle

# Tools & Libraries
- Python

- TensorFlow / Keras

- NumPy

- Matplotlib

# Key Steps
- Data loading and normalization

- Model architecture design (input layer, hidden layers, output layer)

- Training with backpropagation and optimization

- Evaluation on test set

- Visualization of predictions and loss/accuracy metrics

# Model Performance
After training, the model achieves strong accuracy in predicting unseen test images, demonstrating the power of simple neural networks on image classification tasks.

# Future Improvements
- Implement CNN for higher accuracy

- Experiment with regularization (Dropout, L2)

- Hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, batch size, optimizer)

#  Usage
Clone the repo and run the notebook or Python script:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fashion-mnist-mlp.git
cd fashion-mnist-mlp
python train_model.py
